In this project I provided cookies and sessions to be made in the browser once the is registered/logged i.
The complexity of the encryption is very much hard to decrypt and the data is stored into mongodb database.
I also provided the use of OAuth 2.0, which user is granted a third-party web site or application access to the user's 
protected resources.
# New Feature
I also added for user's to submit a secret which then will be published and shown in the secret's page
